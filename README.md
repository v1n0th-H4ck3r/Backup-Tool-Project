# Ransomware-simulation-and-Backup-Project

This project aims to develop a robust ransomware backup verification tool while incorporating a ransomware simulation component. The primary objective is to create a tool that not only tests and validates backup solution or detection tool integrity but also simulates realistic ransomware attack scenarios. The testing will cover diverse scenarios, evaluating the tool's performance across various file sizes, security requirements, and ransomware attack situations. Specific test cases will be designed to ensure the tool's efficacy in detecting ransomware and verifying backup file integrity under varying conditions. Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) will be conducted to identify and address potential weaknesses in detection tools. The project will also encompass scalability assessments, documentation creation, user training, and a commitment to continuous improvement. By combining backup verification and ransomware simulation, the project aims to fortify cybersecurity defenses, providing organizations with a comprehensive solution to mitigate the impact of ransomware attacks.
